<h1>What can I do with this computer?</h1>

<p>Now we all use computers every day, but sometimes it's difficult to work out what we can do with them. <a href="https:www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> is a great resource, but it can be too difficult both in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">English</a> and <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hlavn%C3%AD_strana">Czech</a>. There is also the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">simple English</a> Wikipedia which can be useful, though there are not as many pages to look up. If you are not sure what you want to read here, you could find an random article in <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speci%C3%A1ln%C3%AD:N%C3%A1hodn%C3%A1_str%C3%A1nka">Czech</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">English</a>, or <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Simple English</a>. Just like opening an encyclopedia at any page, you never know what you might find.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we have some content of our own that you can look at, and the <a href="https://duhovkaelementary.wikispaces.com/" title="The Duhovka Elementary Wiki">Duhovka Elementary wiki</a> is ready for you to both read and edit.</p>

<p>The first version of this web page is being written by Rob who runs the Geek Club, and so we would expect to see the programming language <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> here. Other coding resources might be <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> where you can learn <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">html &amp; CSS</a> which is a little more difficult than Scratch, and which is what Rob us using to write this page, and also <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">git</a>, which he is using to store it and to <a href="https://github.com/DuhovkaElementary/DuhovkaWebDesign">allow others to help him work on it</a> (this is much more difficult). Maybe one day a version of this website which has been created by Rob and worked on by him and children in the school may be on the school website where anybody with a computer and an internet connection can see it. For now, though versions of it can be cloned or <a href="https://github.com/DuhovkaElementary/DuhovkaWebDesign/archive/master.zip" download>downloaded from git</a> it is not in fact available directly on the internet. If you see it on your computer it is because it is saved on your computer.</p>

<p>If you can listen to sound on your computer right now, you could do worse than take a look at the video encyclopedia <a href="http://www.check123.com/">Check123</a> which has a number of 1, 2, and 3 minute videos on everything fromm <a href="http://www.check123.com/categories/arts">the arts</a> to <a href="http://www.check123.com/categories/science">science</a>, <a href="http://www.check123.com/categories/history">history</a>, and <a href="http://www.check123.com/categories/tech">technology</a>.</a></p>
